Wouter van Cockelberge and his accomplices have received the supplication of Wouter van Cockelberge living in the freedom of Mechelen. They acknowledge that Wouter van Cockelberge has treated his daughter Peeternelle, who is eighteen years old or around there, with kindness and respect, and that she has refused to marry the man given to her by her friends. Wouter van Cockelberge noticed that Peeternelle\'s godfather, Willem van Wueluwe, had invited her to his house on Easter Monday, and she had come with other suppliants to his house, where she had found Peeternelle with a young man on her lap, asking if she wanted to drink with him. Peeternelle, who was present, said that she would not leave the house and that the other suppliants had come inside as well. One of the suppliants, Jan van Breedonck, took Peeternelle\'s hand and said, \'You must come with me,\' but she refused. Jacop Camerlinck, another suppliant, took a bow and threatened to strike her if she did not come with him. One of the suppliants hit a servant with a stick on the back, and they all left the house and went to Willem van Wueluwe\'s house.
